# Godmode — Complete Design Document

## 1. Vision & Philosophy

**Tagline:** "Turn on Godmode for Claude Code."

**What is Godmode?**
Godmode is a Claude Code skill plugin that gives your AI agent a complete, disciplined development workflow — from idea to optimized, shipped product. It combines:
- **Structured creation** (brainstorm → plan → TDD → build) from superpowers
- **Autonomous optimization** (modify → verify → keep/discard → repeat) from autoresearch
- **A seamless handoff** between building and optimizing

**Core Philosophy — The Godmode Loop:**
```
THINK → BUILD → OPTIMIZE → SHIP → REPEAT
```

Most AI coding tools do one thing well. Godmode does the full cycle:
1. **THINK** — Brainstorm, explore alternatives, design with the user
2. **BUILD** — Plan, test-first, implement with parallel agents and code review
3. **OPTIMIZE** — Autonomous iteration loops with mechanical verification
4. **SHIP** — Structured shipping with pre-flight checks and post-ship monitoring

**Three Principles:**
1. **Discipline before speed** — Design before code, tests before implementation, evidence before claims
2. **Autonomy within constraints** — The agent works independently, but within guardrails (metrics, guards, gates)
3. **Git is memory** — Every experiment is committed, every decision is traceable, every failure is a lesson

## 2. Skill Architecture — The Complete Skill Map

Godmode organizes skills into **4 phases** matching the core loop: THINK → BUILD → OPTIMIZE → SHIP.

### Phase 1: THINK (Design & Discovery)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Brainstorm** | `/godmode:think` | Superpowers | Collaborative design sessions — one question at a time, visual companion, 2-3 approach proposals, spec writing |
| **Predict** | `/godmode:predict` | Autoresearch | Multi-persona expert consensus — 5 expert perspectives evaluate a design/decision before committing |
| **Scenario** | `/godmode:scenario` | Autoresearch | Edge case exploration — 12 dimensions (happy paths, errors, abuse, scale, concurrency, etc.) |

### Phase 2: BUILD (Plan & Implement)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Plan** | `/godmode:plan` | Superpowers + Autoresearch | Decompose spec into 2-5 min tasks with exact file paths, code samples, and dependencies |
| **Build** | `/godmode:build` | Superpowers | Execute plan with TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), parallel agent dispatch, 2-stage code review |
| **Test** | `/godmode:test` | Superpowers | Test-driven development enforcement — write failing test first, then implement |
| **Review** | `/godmode:review` | Superpowers | Dispatch code-reviewer agent, handle feedback with technical rigor |

### Phase 3: OPTIMIZE (Autonomous Iteration)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Optimize** | `/godmode:optimize` | Autoresearch | The core autonomous loop — modify → verify → keep/discard → repeat. Git-as-memory. Mechanical metrics only |
| **Debug** | `/godmode:debug` | Autoresearch | Scientific bug hunting — 7 investigation techniques, autonomous until codebase is clean |
| **Fix** | `/godmode:fix` | Autoresearch | Autonomous error remediation — one fix per iteration until zero errors remain |
| **Secure** | `/godmode:secure` | Autoresearch | STRIDE + OWASP + 4 red-team personas. Structured security audit with code evidence |

### Phase 4: SHIP (Deliver & Monitor)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Ship** | `/godmode:ship` | Autoresearch + Superpowers | 8-phase shipping workflow — inventory, checklist, prepare, dry-run, ship, verify, log |
| **Finish** | `/godmode:finish` | Superpowers | Branch finalization — merge, PR, keep, or discard with full verification |

### Meta Skills (Always Active)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Godmode** | `/godmode` | NEW | The orchestrator — auto-detects what phase you're in and suggests the right skill |
| **Setup** | `/godmode:setup` | Autoresearch | Interactive wizard — configure goal, scope, metric, verify command with dry-run validation |
| **Verify** | `/godmode:verify` | Superpowers | Evidence-before-claims gate — run command → read output → confirm → then claim success |

**Total: 16 skills** (3 THINK + 4 BUILD + 4 OPTIMIZE + 2 SHIP + 3 META)
