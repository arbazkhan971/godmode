# Godmode — Complete Design Document

## 1. Vision & Philosophy

**Tagline:** "Turn on Godmode for Claude Code."

**What is Godmode?**
Godmode is a Claude Code skill plugin that gives your AI agent a complete, disciplined development workflow — from idea to optimized, shipped product. It combines:
- **Structured creation** (brainstorm → plan → TDD → build) from superpowers
- **Autonomous optimization** (modify → verify → keep/discard → repeat) from autoresearch
- **A seamless handoff** between building and optimizing

**Core Philosophy — The Godmode Loop:**
```
THINK → BUILD → OPTIMIZE → SHIP → REPEAT
```

Most AI coding tools do one thing well. Godmode does the full cycle:
1. **THINK** — Brainstorm, explore alternatives, design with the user
2. **BUILD** — Plan, test-first, implement with parallel agents and code review
3. **OPTIMIZE** — Autonomous iteration loops with mechanical verification
4. **SHIP** — Structured shipping with pre-flight checks and post-ship monitoring

**Three Principles:**
1. **Discipline before speed** — Design before code, tests before implementation, evidence before claims
2. **Autonomy within constraints** — The agent works independently, but within guardrails (metrics, guards, gates)
3. **Git is memory** — Every experiment is committed, every decision is traceable, every failure is a lesson

---

## 2. Skill Architecture — The Complete Skill Map

Godmode organizes skills into **4 phases** matching the core loop: THINK → BUILD → OPTIMIZE → SHIP.

### Phase 1: THINK (Design & Discovery)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Brainstorm** | `/godmode:think` | Superpowers | Collaborative design sessions — one question at a time, visual companion, 2-3 approach proposals, spec writing |
| **Predict** | `/godmode:predict` | Autoresearch | Multi-persona expert consensus — 5 expert perspectives evaluate a design/decision before committing |
| **Scenario** | `/godmode:scenario` | Autoresearch | Edge case exploration — 12 dimensions (happy paths, errors, abuse, scale, concurrency, etc.) |

### Phase 2: BUILD (Plan & Implement)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Plan** | `/godmode:plan` | Superpowers + Autoresearch | Decompose spec into 2-5 min tasks with exact file paths, code samples, and dependencies |
| **Build** | `/godmode:build` | Superpowers | Execute plan with TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), parallel agent dispatch, 2-stage code review |
| **Test** | `/godmode:test` | Superpowers | Test-driven development enforcement — write failing test first, then implement |
| **Review** | `/godmode:review` | Superpowers | Dispatch code-reviewer agent, handle feedback with technical rigor |

### Phase 3: OPTIMIZE (Autonomous Iteration)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Optimize** | `/godmode:optimize` | Autoresearch | The core autonomous loop — modify → verify → keep/discard → repeat. Git-as-memory. Mechanical metrics only |
| **Debug** | `/godmode:debug` | Autoresearch | Scientific bug hunting — 7 investigation techniques, autonomous until codebase is clean |
| **Fix** | `/godmode:fix` | Autoresearch | Autonomous error remediation — one fix per iteration until zero errors remain |
| **Secure** | `/godmode:secure` | Autoresearch | STRIDE + OWASP + 4 red-team personas. Structured security audit with code evidence |

### Phase 4: SHIP (Deliver & Monitor)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Ship** | `/godmode:ship` | Autoresearch + Superpowers | 8-phase shipping workflow — inventory, checklist, prepare, dry-run, ship, verify, log |
| **Finish** | `/godmode:finish` | Superpowers | Branch finalization — merge, PR, keep, or discard with full verification |

### Meta Skills (Always Active)

| Skill | Command | Origin | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Godmode** | `/godmode` | NEW | The orchestrator — auto-detects what phase you're in and suggests the right skill |
| **Setup** | `/godmode:setup` | Autoresearch | Interactive wizard — configure goal, scope, metric, verify command with dry-run validation |
| **Verify** | `/godmode:verify` | Superpowers | Evidence-before-claims gate — run command → read output → confirm → then claim success |

**Total: 16 skills** (3 THINK + 4 BUILD + 4 OPTIMIZE + 2 SHIP + 3 META)

---

## 3. Plugin File Structure

Godmode ships as a single Claude Code skill plugin directory. Every file has a purpose; no config sprawl.

```

### Key design decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| One `SKILL.md` per skill | Claude Code discovers skills by finding `SKILL.md` files — one file = one command |
| `references/` directories | Heavy content lives here — keeps SKILL.md focused on workflow, references hold deep knowledge |
| `shared/` directory | Cross-cutting concerns (git conventions, logging, handoff) stay DRY |
| `templates/` where needed | Skills that produce artifacts (specs, plans, reports) include output templates |
| `hooks/` at root level | Session and lifecycle hooks run automatically, not invoked as skills |
| `settings.json` at root | Single config file, overridable per-project via `.godmode/settings.json` in project root |

### File count

- **16 SKILL.md files** (one per skill, plus the root orchestrator)
- **~20 reference files** (deep knowledge, protocols, databases)
- **~4 shared files** (cross-cutting concerns)
- **~50 total files** — small enough to ship, large enough to be comprehensive

---

## 4. Skill File Format

Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` file. Claude Code reads this file when the skill is invoked, so it must be self-contained (or reference files it can load).

### SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description (shown in skill discovery)
triggers:
  - /godmode:skillname
  - natural language trigger phrases
phase: THINK | BUILD | OPTIMIZE | SHIP | META
requires: [list, of, prerequisite, skills]  # optional
flags:
  --flag-name: "description of flag"        # optional
  --iterations: "max iteration count"       # optional
---

# Skill Name

## When to Use
[Trigger conditions — when does this skill activate?]

## Workflow
[Step-by-step instructions for the agent to follow]

### Step 1: [Name]
[Detailed instructions]

### Step 2: [Name]
[Detailed instructions]

## Key Behaviors
[Critical rules the agent must follow]

## References
[Links to files in the references/ directory]
- @references/protocol-name.md

## Example Usage
[Concrete examples of invoking and using the skill]
```

### Frontmatter Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Kebab-case skill identifier |
| `description` | string | Yes | One-line description, max 120 chars |
| `triggers` | string[] | Yes | Slash commands and natural language phrases |
| `phase` | enum | Yes | Which phase this skill belongs to |
| `requires` | string[] | No | Skills that must run before this one |
| `flags` | map | No | CLI flags the skill accepts |

### References Directory Pattern

References are loaded on demand using the `@references/filename.md` directive. The agent reads these files only when the workflow step requires them.

```markdown
## Workflow

### Step 3: Evaluate Security
Load the threat model reference:
@references/stride-owasp.md

Apply each category from the reference to the current codebase.
```

**Why this pattern?**
- Keeps SKILL.md small and scannable (~100-200 lines)
- References can be shared across skills via symlinks or `@shared/filename.md`
- Heavy knowledge (persona definitions, metric databases, protocol details) doesn't bloat the skill file
- References are versioned with the plugin — no external dependencies

### Templates Directory Pattern

Skills that produce artifacts include templates:

```markdown
## Workflow

### Step 5: Write the Spec
Use the spec template:
@templates/spec-template.md

Fill in each section based on the brainstorming session.
```

### Naming Conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Skill directory | lowercase, singular | `think/`, `build/`, `secure/` |
| SKILL.md | Always uppercase | `SKILL.md` |
| References | kebab-case | `brainstorm-protocol.md` |
| Templates | kebab-case with `-template` suffix | `spec-template.md` |
| Shared files | kebab-case | `git-memory.md` |

---

## 5. The Orchestrator — `/godmode`

The `/godmode` command is the entry point. It detects where you are in the development cycle and routes you to the right skill.

### Auto-Detection Algorithm

When the user types `/godmode` without a sub-command, the orchestrator inspects project state:

```
1. Check for .godmode/state.json          → Resume in-progress workflow
2. Check git log for recent commits        → Detect current phase
3. Check for failing tests                 → Route to /godmode:fix or /godmode:debug
4. Check for uncommitted changes           → Route to /godmode:review or /godmode:ship
5. Check for TODO/FIXME in codebase        → Route to /godmode:plan
6. Check if spec exists but no code        → Route to /godmode:build
7. Check if code exists but no tests       → Route to /godmode:test
8. Check if code exists but no spec        → Route to /godmode:think
9. Default                                 → Start fresh with /godmode:think
```

### State File (`.godmode/state.json`)

```json
{
  "phase": "BUILD",
  "active_skill": "build",
  "iteration": 3,
  "plan_file": ".godmode/plan.md",
  "current_task": "task-003",
  "metrics": {
    "tests_passing": 42,
    "test_coverage": 0.78,
    "lint_errors": 0
  },
  "history": [
    { "skill": "think", "completed": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" },
    { "skill": "plan", "completed": "2025-01-15T10:15:00Z" },
    { "skill": "build", "started": "2025-01-15T10:20:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

### Smart Routing Table

| Detected State | Routed To | Reason |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| No project context | `/godmode:setup` | Need to configure first |
| Fresh start, no spec | `/godmode:think` | Start with design |
| Spec exists, no plan | `/godmode:plan` | Decompose the spec |
| Plan exists, tasks remain | `/godmode:build` | Execute next task |
| All tasks done, tests pass | `/godmode:optimize` | Improve what exists |
| Optimization plateau | `/godmode:ship` | Time to deliver |
| Failing tests | `/godmode:fix` | Fix before continuing |
| Security review pending | `/godmode:secure` | Audit before shipping |
| Ready to merge | `/godmode:finish` | Finalize the branch |

### User Override

The user can always bypass auto-detection:

```
/godmode:think           # Force brainstorming
/godmode:optimize        # Jump straight to optimization
/godmode --phase BUILD   # Force a specific phase
/godmode --reset         # Clear state, start fresh
```

### Orchestrator Output

When invoked, the orchestrator prints:

```
🔍 Godmode — Analyzing project state...

Phase:     BUILD (task 3 of 7)
Last skill: /godmode:build (15 min ago)
Tests:     42 passing, 0 failing
Coverage:  78%

→ Recommended: /godmode:build (continue task 4: "Add auth middleware")
→ Alternatives: /godmode:test, /godmode:review

Proceed with recommendation? [Y/n/choose]
```

## 6. `/godmode:think` — Brainstorm Skill Spec

**Origin:** Superpowers (structured brainstorming protocol)
**Phase:** THINK
**Purpose:** Collaborative design sessions that produce a written spec through disciplined, one-question-at-a-time exploration.

### Trigger Conditions

- User says "let's brainstorm", "I have an idea", "help me design", "let's think about"
- Orchestrator detects no spec exists for current work
- Explicitly invoked with `/godmode:think`

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--visual` | false | Launch visual companion in browser |
| `--approaches` | 3 | Number of approaches to propose (2-5) |
| `--spec` | true | Write a spec at the end |
| `--review` | true | Run review loop on the spec |

### Workflow

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- Ask ONE question at a time (never batch questions)
- Listen to the answer completely before asking the next
- Build understanding incrementally
- Stop asking when you have enough to propose approaches (usually 3-7 questions)

**Step 2: Propose Approaches**
- Present 2-3 distinct approaches (not variations of the same idea)
- Each approach gets: name, one-paragraph description, pros, cons, complexity estimate
- Format as a comparison table
- Ask the user to pick one (or combine elements)

**Step 3: Deep Dive on Chosen Approach**
- Explore the chosen approach in detail
- Ask clarifying questions specific to this approach
- Identify technical decisions that need to be made
- Map out the components/modules involved

**Step 4: Write the Spec**
- Produce a structured spec document using `@templates/spec-template.md`
- Spec includes: problem statement, chosen approach, components, API surface, data model, edge cases, open questions
- Save to `.godmode/specs/SPEC-NAME.md`

**Step 5: Review Loop**
- Read the spec back to the user section by section
- Ask "Does this capture what you want?" for each section
- Iterate until the user approves
- Final spec is committed: `git commit -m "spec: SPEC-NAME"`

### Key Behaviors

1. **One question at a time** — Never ask "What's the goal and who are the users and what's the tech stack?" Ask one, wait, ask the next.
2. **No premature solutions** — Spend time understanding before proposing
3. **Concrete over abstract** — "Show me what the API call looks like" not "describe the interface"
4. **User drives decisions** — Present options, never decide for the user
5. **Spec is the output** — The brainstorm isn't done until there's a written, reviewed spec

### Example Usage

```
User: /godmode:think
Agent: What are you building? (one question to start)

User: A rate limiter for our API
Agent: What's the current setup — is this a new API or adding rate limiting to an existing one?

User: Existing Express.js API, about 40 endpoints
Agent: Are there different rate limit needs for different endpoints, or one global limit?

[... 3-5 more questions ...]

Agent: Here are 3 approaches:

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------|------|------------|
| Token Bucket | Classic token bucket with Redis backend | Battle-tested, flexible | Requires Redis | Medium |
| Sliding Window | In-memory sliding window per IP | No external deps | Doesn't scale past one process | Low |
| API Gateway | Move rate limiting to nginx/Kong | Offloads from app | Infrastructure change | High |

Which approach works best for your situation?
```

### Visual Companion Integration

When `--visual` is active:
- Launch browser-based brainstorming canvas
- Display questions, answers, and approaches in real-time
- Allow user to rearrange, annotate, and connect ideas
- Export canvas state as part of the spec
- See Section 27 for full Visual Companion spec

---

## 7. `/godmode:predict` — Multi-Persona Prediction Skill Spec

**Origin:** Autoresearch (multi-persona expert panel)
**Phase:** THINK
**Purpose:** Evaluate a design decision or approach through 5 expert personas, reaching consensus before committing to implementation.

### Trigger Conditions

- User says "will this work?", "what could go wrong?", "evaluate this approach"
- Before a major architectural decision
- After `/godmode:think` produces a spec that needs validation
- Explicitly invoked with `/godmode:predict`

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--personas` | 5 | Number of expert personas (3-7) |
| `--domain` | auto | Domain for persona selection (web, ml, systems, mobile, etc.) |
| `--decision` | — | Specific decision to evaluate (overrides auto-detect) |
| `--format` | table | Output format: `table`, `prose`, `json` |

### The 5 Expert Personas

| Persona | Perspective | Evaluates |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **The Architect** | System design, scalability, maintainability | Does the architecture hold up at 10x scale? |
| **The Skeptic** | Risk, failure modes, hidden complexity | What will break? What's being overlooked? |
| **The User** | UX, developer experience, usability | Is this actually pleasant to use? |
| **The Operator** | Deployment, monitoring, debugging in prod | Can I run this at 3am when it breaks? |
| **The Newcomer** | Onboarding, documentation, learning curve | Can someone new understand this in 30 min? |

Personas rotate based on `--domain`:
- **ML domain:** Adds "The Data Scientist" (data quality, model drift, reproducibility)
- **Security domain:** Adds "The Attacker" (exploit paths, abuse scenarios)
- **Frontend domain:** Adds "The Accessibility Expert" (a11y, screen readers, keyboard nav)

### Workflow

**Step 1: Frame the Decision**
- Identify the specific decision being evaluated
- Summarize the context (what exists, what's proposed, what alternatives were considered)
- State the decision clearly: "We're deciding whether to X or Y"

**Step 2: Persona Evaluation**
- Each persona evaluates independently
- Each persona produces:
  - **Verdict:** APPROVE / CONCERN / REJECT
  - **Confidence:** 1-5
  - **Key insight:** One sentence
  - **Evidence:** Specific technical reasoning

**Step 3: Consensus Matrix**

```
┌─────────────┬─────────┬────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│ Persona     │ Verdict │ Confidence │ Key Insight                  │
├─────────────┼─────────┼────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ Architect   │ APPROVE │ 4/5        │ Clean separation of concerns │
│ Skeptic     │ CONCERN │ 3/5        │ Redis SPOF needs failover    │
│ User        │ APPROVE │ 5/5        │ Simple API, good defaults    │
│ Operator    │ CONCERN │ 4/5        │ Need metrics dashboard       │
│ Newcomer    │ APPROVE │ 4/5        │ Good docs, clear examples    │
├─────────────┼─────────┼────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ CONSENSUS   │ PROCEED │ 4.0 avg    │ Proceed with 2 mitigations   │
└─────────────┴─────────┴────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 4: Synthesis**
- Aggregate verdicts into a final recommendation
- Consensus rules:
  - All APPROVE → **PROCEED**
  - Any CONCERN → **PROCEED WITH MITIGATIONS** (list them)
  - Any REJECT → **RECONSIDER** (list blocking issues)
  - Majority REJECT → **STOP** (fundamental problems)

**Step 5: Action Items**
- List specific mitigations to address concerns
- Each mitigation becomes a task in the plan (if `/godmode:plan` runs next)
- Commit the prediction report: `git commit -m "predict: DECISION-NAME consensus"`

### Key Behaviors

1. **Personas argue independently** — Don't let one persona's view contaminate another
2. **Evidence-based** — Each verdict must cite specific technical reasoning, not vibes
3. **Concerns are gifts** — A CONCERN verdict is more valuable than a rubber-stamp APPROVE
4. **Actionable output** — Every concern must have a corresponding mitigation
5. **Not a gate** — The user decides whether to proceed; the prediction informs, not blocks

### Example Usage

```
User: /godmode:predict --decision "Use Redis for rate limiting vs in-memory"

Agent:
┌─────────────┬─────────┬────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Persona     │ Verdict │ Confidence │ Key Insight                     │
├─────────────┼─────────┼────────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Architect   │ APPROVE │ 5/5        │ Redis enables horizontal scale  │
│ Skeptic     │ CONCERN │ 4/5        │ Redis connection pool can leak  │
│ User        │ APPROVE │ 4/5        │ Transparent to API consumers    │
│ Operator    │ CONCERN │ 3/5        │ Another service to monitor      │
│ Newcomer    │ APPROVE │ 3/5        │ Redis is well-documented        │
├─────────────┼─────────┼────────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
│ CONSENSUS   │ PROCEED │ 3.8 avg    │ Proceed with 2 mitigations      │
└─────────────┴─────────┴────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘

Mitigations:
1. Add connection pool health check and auto-reconnect
2. Add Redis metrics to monitoring dashboard
```

## 8. `/godmode:scenario` — Edge Case Explorer Skill Spec

**Origin:** Autoresearch (scenario exploration)
**Phase:** THINK
**Purpose:** Systematically explore edge cases across 12 dimensions before writing code, so edge cases are designed for — not discovered in production.

### Trigger Conditions

- After a spec is written and before planning
- User says "what could go wrong?", "edge cases", "what am I missing?"
- Explicitly invoked with `/godmode:scenario`

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dimensions` | all | Which dimensions to explore (comma-separated, or "all") |
| `--depth` | medium | Exploration depth: `shallow` (1 per dimension), `medium` (3), `deep` (5+) |
| `--target` | auto | Target component/feature to explore |
| `--output` | table | Output format: `table`, `checklist`, `test-cases` |

### The 12 Exploration Dimensions

| # | Dimension | Question | Examples |
|---|-----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Happy Path** | Does the normal case actually work? | Standard input, expected user, typical load |
| 2 | **Empty/Null** | What happens with nothing? | Empty string, null, undefined, zero, empty array |
| 3 | **Boundary** | What happens at the edges? | Max int, min int, exactly at limit, one over limit |
| 4 | **Invalid Input** | What happens with garbage? | Wrong type, malformed JSON, SQL injection, XSS |
| 5 | **Concurrency** | What happens when multiple things happen at once? | Race conditions, deadlocks, double-submit |
| 6 | **Scale** | What happens at 10x/100x/1000x? | 1M rows, 10K concurrent users, 1GB payload |
| 7 | **Failure** | What happens when dependencies fail? | DB down, API timeout, disk full, OOM |
| 8 | **State** | What happens with unexpected state? | Stale cache, partial migration, corrupted data |
| 9 | **Time** | What happens with time? | Timezone changes, DST, leap seconds, clock skew |
| 10 | **Permission** | What happens with wrong access? | Unauthorized, expired token, role escalation |
| 11 | **Abuse** | How could this be deliberately misused? | DDoS, scraping, data exfiltration, account takeover |
| 12 | **Recovery** | Can the system recover? | Restart mid-operation, restore from backup, rollback |

### Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Target**
- Read the spec or codebase to identify the component under exploration
- List the key operations/endpoints/functions to explore

**Step 2: Dimension Sweep**
- For each dimension, generate concrete scenarios
- Each scenario includes:
  - **Scenario:** One-sentence description
  - **Input:** What triggers this scenario
  - **Expected:** What should happen
  - **Risk:** LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
  - **Handled?:** YES / NO / PARTIAL

**Step 3: Produce Scenario Matrix**

```
Dimension: CONCURRENCY
┌───┬────────────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ # │ Scenario                   │ Risk     │ Handled? │
├───┼────────────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ 1 │ Two users claim same item  │ HIGH     │ NO       │
│ 2 │ Rate limit counter race    │ MEDIUM   │ PARTIAL  │
│ 3 │ Cache invalidation during  │ LOW      │ YES      │
│   │ concurrent writes          │          │          │
└───┴────────────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

**Step 4: Risk Summary**
- Count unhandled scenarios by risk level
- Produce a risk heatmap across dimensions
- Highlight the top 5 most dangerous unhandled scenarios

**Step 5: Generate Artifacts**
- If `--output test-cases`: Generate test stubs for each unhandled scenario
- If `--output checklist`: Generate a TODO checklist for the plan
- Commit scenario report: `git commit -m "scenario: TARGET-NAME edge case exploration"`

### Key Behaviors

1. **Concrete, not abstract** — "User submits form twice in 200ms" not "concurrency issues"
2. **Every dimension gets attention** — Don't skip dimensions that seem irrelevant; that's where surprises hide
3. **Risk-ranked** — Not all edge cases are equal; focus attention on HIGH/CRITICAL
4. **Feeds into planning** — Unhandled scenarios become tasks in `/godmode:plan`
5. **Test-case ready** — Each scenario should be specific enough to write a test for

### Example Usage

```
User: /godmode:scenario --target "rate limiter" --depth deep --output test-cases

Agent: Exploring 12 dimensions for "rate limiter"...

TOP 5 UNHANDLED RISKS:
1. [CRITICAL] Clock skew between servers causes inconsistent rate limits
2. [HIGH] Redis connection dies mid-increment, counter stuck
3. [HIGH] Distributed race: two servers both allow request #100 of 100
4. [MEDIUM] User rotates API key to reset rate limit
5. [MEDIUM] Burst of 10K requests in 1ms overwhelms token bucket refill

Generated 23 test stubs → saved to tests/rate-limiter.scenario.test.ts
```

## 9. `/godmode:plan` — Planning Skill Spec

**Origin:** Superpowers + Autoresearch (task decomposition)
**Phase:** BUILD
**Purpose:** Decompose a spec into small (2-5 minute), actionable tasks with exact file paths, code samples, dependencies, and test criteria.

### Trigger Conditions

- A spec exists but no plan has been created
- User says "plan this", "break this down", "create tasks"
- Orchestrator routes here after THINK phase completes
- Explicitly invoked with `/godmode:plan`

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--spec` | auto | Path to spec file (auto-detects from `.godmode/specs/`) |
| `--max-tasks` | 20 | Maximum number of tasks to generate |
| `--task-size` | 5min | Target task duration: `2min`, `5min`, `10min` |
| `--review` | true | Present plan to user for review before saving |
| `--parallel` | true | Identify which tasks can run in parallel |

### Workflow

**Step 1: Read the Spec**
- Load the spec from `.godmode/specs/` or the path provided
- Also load scenario results if they exist (unhandled edge cases become tasks)
- Also load prediction mitigations if they exist (concerns become tasks)

**Step 2: Identify Components**
- Map the spec to concrete code components:
  - Files to create
  - Files to modify
  - Dependencies to install
  - Configuration to add

**Step 3: Decompose into Tasks**
- Each task is 2-5 minutes of agent work
- Each task has:

```markdown
### Task 003: Add rate limit middleware

**Files:** `src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts` (CREATE), `src/app.ts` (MODIFY)
**Dependencies:** `ioredis` (INSTALL)
**Depends on:** Task 001 (Redis connection), Task 002 (config schema)
**Parallel group:** B (can run alongside Task 004)
**Test:** `tests/rate-limiter.test.ts` — "should return 429 after 100 requests"
**Acceptance:** Rate limiter middleware exists, passes 3 test cases
**Estimated time:** 4 min

**Implementation notes:**
- Use token bucket algorithm from spec section 3.2
- Default: 100 requests per 60-second window
- Key format: `ratelimit:{ip}:{endpoint}`
```

**Step 4: Build Dependency Graph**
- Map task dependencies into execution order
- Identify parallel groups (tasks with no interdependencies)
- Produce a visual execution plan:

```
Phase A (sequential):
  Task 001: Redis connection module
  Task 002: Config schema

Phase B (parallel):          Phase C (parallel):
  Task 003: Rate limiter       Task 004: Logging
  Task 005: Error handler      Task 006: Health check

Phase D (sequential):
  Task 007: Integration tests
  Task 008: Documentation
```

**Step 5: Plan Review**
- Present the complete plan to the user
- Show: task count, estimated total time, dependency graph, parallel opportunities
- User can: approve, reorder, split tasks, merge tasks, remove tasks, add tasks
- Iterate until approved

**Step 6: Save Plan**
- Save to `.godmode/plan.md`
- Update `.godmode/state.json` with plan reference
- Commit: `git commit -m "plan: FEATURE-NAME — N tasks, estimated Xmin"`

### Task Schema

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Task identifier (e.g., `task-003`) |
| `title` | Yes | Short description |
| `files` | Yes | Files to create/modify with action (CREATE/MODIFY/DELETE) |
| `dependencies` | No | Package dependencies to install |
| `depends_on` | No | Task IDs that must complete first |
| `parallel_group` | No | Letter indicating parallel execution group |
| `test` | Yes | Test file and description of what to test |
| `acceptance` | Yes | Clear criteria for task completion |
| `estimated_time` | Yes | Estimated agent time in minutes |
| `notes` | No | Implementation hints, code samples, gotchas |

### Key Behaviors

1. **2-5 minute tasks** — If a task takes longer, it should be split
2. **Every task has a test** — No task is complete without a passing test
3. **File paths are exact** — Not "add a middleware" but "create `src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts`"
4. **Dependencies are explicit** — No hidden coupling between tasks
5. **User approves the plan** — The plan is a contract; don't start building without approval
